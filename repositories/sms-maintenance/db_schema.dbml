  Note: '''# Small Molecule Suite

  **Based on ChEMBL v27**

  The [Small Molecule Suite (SMS)](https://labsyspharm.shinyapps.io/smallmoleculesuite/)
  is a free, open-acces tool developed
  by the [Harvard Program in Therapeutic Sciences (HiTS)](https://hits.harvard.edu/).

  The database contains all data underlying SMS.

  The goal of the SMS is to help scientists understand and work with the targets
  of molecular probes, approved drugs and other drug-like molecules, while
  acknowledging the complexity of polypharmacology â€” the phenomenon that
  virtually all drug-like molecules bind multiple target proteins.

  SMS combines data from the ChEMBL database with prepublished data from the
  Laboratory of Systems pharmacology. The methodology of calculating
  selectivities and similarities are explained in Moret et al. Cell Chem Biol
  2019 (which can also be used to cite the Small Molecule Suite).
